You'll find a collection of my public products, scripts, or code repositories here. Almost all of my work or commissioned repositories are private. The remaining are either playground materials or small projects. If you have a suggestion or there is something you would like to see me work on in the future, drop an issue **[here](https://github.com/ozgurozbek/ozgurozbek/issues)**!

You should definitely [check out my D&D5E Quest Idea Generator](https://xeculus.pythonanywhere.com/)! It has generated over a million prompts and is used by 100000+ individuals!

### Private Repositories

I worked for [Toyota TM&S](https://www.linkedin.com/company/toyotaturkeymarketingandsales/), [Unico Studio](https://www.linkedin.com/company/unico-studio/) and [Inveon](https://www.linkedin.com/company/inveon/) - [Devends](https://www.linkedin.com/company/devends/about/). Unfortunately, those organizations are private, therefore I can't provide organization repositories.
